# Epic 8 - Phase 1 Complete: Category 1 Research

**Date:** 2025-11-12 (Session 10)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Production Deployment
**Scope:** 35 of 36 Category 1 multi-pronunciation characters

---

## 📊 Summary

Successfully researched, documented, and generated migration for **35 confirmed multi-pronunciation characters** from Epic 8 Category 1.

**Note:** Character '干' excluded from Migration 011 due to database quality issue (see below).
**Correction:** Original documentation claimed 37 Category 1 characters, but actual list had 36.

### Characters Covered (35 deployed)
行, 重, 还, 为, 给, 都, 没, 教, 正, 更, 传, 供, 便, 假, 几, 切, 划, 地, 场, 将, 应, 弹, 扫, 把, 担, 相, 省, 种, 系, 结, 觉, 角, 调, 量, 什

### Character Excluded (1 total)
**干** - Database missing separate entries for '幹' (to do) and '乾' (dry). See `docs/operational/EPIC8_PHASE2_GAN_ISSUE.md` for resolution plan.

## 🎯 Deliverables

### 1. Research Data
**File:** `data/multi_pronunciation_category1_complete.json` (1,749 lines)

**Contents:**
- Research for 36 characters total (35 deployed + 1 deferred)
- Default pronunciation + variants with zhuyin arrays
- 2-4 context words per pronunciation
- English meanings for each variant
- HSK levels where available
- Usage notes for each character

**Quality:**
- Sourced from MDBG, Context Chinese Dictionary, Chinese Grammar Wiki
- Verified for Taiwan Mandarin standard
- Common usage examples included

### 2. Migration SQL
**File:** `supabase/migrations/011_dictionary_quality_category1_complete.sql` (521 lines)

**Features:**
- Safety check: Validates all 35 characters exist before updating
- UPDATE statements for 35 characters (干 excluded)
- Preserves main zhuyin, adds variants to `zhuyin_variants` array
- Verification queries to confirm updates
- Rollback script included in comments

**Exclusion:**
- Character '干' excluded - requires separate data cleanup migration
- See `docs/operational/EPIC8_PHASE2_GAN_ISSUE.md` for details

### 3. Supporting Scripts
- `scripts/compile-category1-complete.cjs` - Generates complete JSON from research
- `scripts/generate-migration-011.cjs` - Generates SQL from JSON data

## 🔍 Research Highlights

### Most Common Characters (HSK 1-2)
- **行** (xíng/háng) - walk vs row/profession
- **重** (zhòng/chóng) - heavy vs repeat
- **还** (hái/huán) - still vs return
- **给** (gěi/jǐ) - give vs supply
- **都** (dōu/dū) - all vs capital
- **没** (méi/mò) - not vs sink
- **教** (jiāo/jiào) - teach vs education
- **正** (zhèng/zhēng) - correct vs first month
- **几** (jǐ/jī) - how many vs table
- **地** (dì/de) - earth vs -ly suffix

### Interesting Cases
- **便** (biàn/pián) - pián only appears in 便宜 (cheap)
- **什** (shén/shí) - shén in 什么 (what), shí rarely used
- **正** (zhèng/zhēng) - zhēng only in 正月 (first lunar month)
- **把** (bǎ/bà) - bǎ extremely common, bà rare (handle)

## ✅ Next Steps

### 1. **Backup Dictionary (REQUIRED)**
```bash
node scripts/backup-dictionary.js
```
Creates: `data/backups/dictionary_backup_pre_011_YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### 2. **Test Migration Locally (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Apply to local Supabase instance
supabase db reset
# Then apply migrations 001-011

# Or use psql directly
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres < supabase/migrations/011_dictionary_quality_category1_complete.sql
```

### 3. **Verify Results**
Run the verification queries at the end of Migration 011:
```sql
SELECT simp, trad, zhuyin, zhuyin_variants,
       jsonb_array_length(zhuyin_variants) as variant_count
FROM dictionary_entries
WHERE simp IN ('行', '重', '还', ... )
ORDER BY simp;
```

Expected: All 35 characters should have `variant_count > 0`

### 4. **Apply to Production**
Via Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor:
1. Copy contents of Migration 011
2. Run in production (takes ~5 seconds)
3. Verify with SELECT queries (should return 35 characters with variants)
4. Test in AddItemForm - should see variant selection UI

## 📈 Impact

### Dictionary Quality Improvement
- **Before:** 885/1,067 characters properly structured (83%)
- **After Migration 011:** 920/1,067 characters (86.2%)
- **Improvement:** +35 characters (+3.3%)

### User Experience
- **Multi-pronunciation characters** now show variant selection in AddItemForm
- Parents can choose correct pronunciation based on context words
- Example: 行 → Choose between "步行/旅行" (xíng) or "银行/行业" (háng)

### Remaining Work (Epic 8 Phase 2)
- **1 character** ('干') requires data cleanup - add separate entries for '幹' and '乾'
  - See: `docs/operational/EPIC8_PHASE2_GAN_ISSUE.md`
  - Estimated: 1 hour (Migration 012)
- **102 characters** in Category 2 (ambiguous cases) require triage
  - Need to determine: true multi-pronunciation vs data errors
  - Estimated: 8 hours research + 3 hours implementation
  - Timeline: Epic 8 Phase 2 (separate session)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Research Process
1. **MDBG as primary source** - Most comprehensive, HSK levels included
2. **WebFetch effective** - Direct dictionary lookups faster than searching
3. **Context words critical** - Help users distinguish pronunciations
4. **Batch processing** - Research 5 characters at time = optimal pace

### Technical Decisions
1. **Programmatic generation** - Script-based JSON compilation prevents errors
2. **Safety checks in SQL** - Validate character existence before updates
3. **Preserve main zhuyin** - Only add variants, don't modify defaults
4. **Include rollback** - Easy reversion if issues discovered

### Time Estimates (Actual)
- Research 10 chars: ~45 min (initial)
- Research 27 chars: ~1.5 hours (with efficiency gains)
- Compile JSON: ~15 min
- Generate migration: ~10 min
- **Total:** ~2.5 hours for complete Category 1

## 🔍 Discovery: '干/幹/乾' Data Quality Issue

During Migration 011 deployment, discovered database is missing entries for '幹' (to do) and '乾' (dry):

**Problem:**
- Database has 1 malformed entry: `{simp: '干', trad: '干', zhuyin: [gān, gàn]}`
- Missing: Separate entries for '幹' (gàn) and '乾' (gān)
- Impact: 2 HSK characters unavailable for practice

**Resolution:**
- Character '干' excluded from Migration 011 (35 deployed, 1 deferred)
- Comprehensive Phase 2 plan documented: `docs/operational/EPIC8_PHASE2_GAN_ISSUE.md`
- Estimated fix: Migration 012 (1 hour) - DELETE malformed entry, INSERT proper entries

**Count Correction:**
- Original documentation claimed 37 Category 1 characters
- Actual Category 1 list had 36 characters (not 37)
- With '干' excluded: 35 characters deployed in Migration 011

## ✨ Session 10 Complete

**Repository cleanup + Epic 8 Category 1 research = DONE!**
