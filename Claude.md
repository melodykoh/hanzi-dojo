# Hanzi Dojo (漢字道場) - Claude Development Context

## 📁 **REPOSITORY ORGANIZATION & SESSION PROTOCOL**

### **MANDATORY: Session Start Organization Check**

**Before ANY work each session:**

1. **Read `REPO_STRUCTURE.md`** — This is the canonical structure reference
2. **Scan root directory** — Flag any scattered files that violate structure
3. **Check for misplaced files:**
   - Root should only have: configs, `CLAUDE.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `REPO_STRUCTURE.md`, `README.md`
   - QA/testing docs belong in `/docs/operational/`
   - Session-specific summaries are redundant (delete them, use `SESSION_LOG.md` instead)
   - All source code belongs in `/src/`
4. **Propose cleanup** before proceeding with feature work

### **Structure Enforcement Principles**

> **"No scattered files. Every file has one obvious home."**

- **Root level**: Minimal — only configs and 4 core docs
- **`/docs`**: Specifications at root, operational docs in `/docs/operational/`
- **`/src`**: All application code with co-located tests
- **Test files**: Always co-located with source (e.g., `drillBuilders.ts` + `drillBuilders.test.ts`)
- **No session archives**: `SESSION_LOG.md` is append-only, single source of truth

### **Documentation Strategy — When to Update Which File**

| File | Purpose | Update When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **`CLAUDE.md`** | Current state, active priorities, requirements, constraints | • Requirements discovered<br>• Architecture decisions made<br>• Priorities/status change<br>• Known issues evolve |
| **`SESSION_LOG.md`** | Historical narrative, detailed session progress | • Each session: append summary<br>• Major milestones reached<br>• Technical discoveries made<br>• Blockers/resolutions logged |
| **`REPO_STRUCTURE.md`** | Canonical file organization | • New directories added<br>• Structure principles refined<br>• Migration plans created |
| **`/docs/*.md`** | Product specifications | • Requirements finalized<br>• Architecture solidified<br>• Design patterns established |
| **`/docs/operational/*.md`** | QA checklists, testing guides | • Test strategies defined<br>• QA procedures documented<br>• Coverage targets set |

### **Documentation Discipline**

**Always document:**
- ✅ Requirement discoveries → `CLAUDE.md` + `SESSION_LOG.md`
- ✅ Architecture decisions → `CLAUDE.md` + `/docs/TECH_AND_LOGIC.md`
- ✅ Session progress → `SESSION_LOG.md` (append-only)
- ✅ Current priority/status → `CLAUDE.md`

**Never create:**
- ❌ Session-specific summary files (use `SESSION_LOG.md` instead)
- ❌ Scattered markdown files in root
- ❌ Duplicate documentation across multiple files
- ❌ "NEXT_SESSION.md" files (planning belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or `SESSION_LOG.md`)

### **Session Start Checklist**

Before coding:
- [ ] Read `REPO_STRUCTURE.md` to refresh on organization
- [ ] Scan root directory for misplaced files
- [ ] Review `CLAUDE.md` for current priority and constraints
- [ ] Check `SESSION_LOG.md` for recent context
- [ ] Propose cleanup if structure violations found
- [ ] Confirm user's priority for today's session

### **Deployment Workflow Checklist**

For significant changes (>50 lines or >3 files):
- [ ] Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/name`
- [ ] Commit with descriptive message and co-author
- [ ] Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/name`
- [ ] Create PR: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..." --base main`
- [ ] Wait for Vercel preview (~2 min), test thoroughly
- [ ] Merge via GitHub UI or `gh pr merge <#>`
- [ ] Update local: `git checkout main && git pull`
- [ ] Clean up: `git branch -d feature/name`
- [ ] Verify production at https://hanzi-dojo.vercel.app

## 🚨 **MANDATORY: Complete Before Any Coding**

### Requirements Gathering Checklist
- [ ] Capture current parent/child practice workflow via user walkthrough
- [ ] Collect 2–3 representative characters/words with expected drill behavior
- [ ] Confirm measurable success metrics (<250 ms drill latency, weekly engagement, data integrity)
- [ ] Enumerate known failure modes (missing dictionary entry, offline usage, duplicate adds)
- [ ] Summarize requirements for user sign-off
- [ ] Define automatic disqualifiers (e.g., characters lacking Zhuyin/Trad pairing)

### Initial Discovery Questions to Ask (if unanswered)
1. How are characters currently tracked and reviewed manually?
2. What constitutes a successful training session for parent and child?
3. Provide examples of tricky characters (tone variants, identical Trad/Simp) we must handle.
4. Which entries should be excluded or deferred?
5. Is accuracy more critical than speed, and what is the tolerance for wrong retries?
6. How should the system react when the child encounters an unsupported character?

---

## 📋 **PROJECT REQUIREMENTS**

### What We're Building
- A React + Supabase dojo-themed trainer where children practice Mandarin characters through Drill A (Zhuyin recognition) and Drill B (Simplified→Traditional) with familiarity scoring (+1.0 / +0.5) driving belt progression.
- Parent console manages entries, monitors analytics (weekly familiarity, accuracy, known count), and launches full-screen kid training mode (landscape-optimized, parent supervision assumed).

### Current Manual Workflow
- Pending user walkthrough; assumption: parent currently curates character lists offline (spreadsheets/flashcards) and coaches pronunciation manually.
- Document actual steps once confirmed; align UI flows with that cadence (add character → practice → review).

### Success Metrics
- **Primary:** Drill interactions respond within <250 ms and familiarity updates correctly.
- **Secondary:** Weekly familiarity gains visible to parents; belts progress without regression; dictionary auto-fill success rate improves over time.
- **Quality thresholds:** No orphaned entries without Supabase dictionary backing; offline guard prevents training without connectivity.

### Automatic Disqualifiers
- Characters lacking Zhuyin or Traditional mapping after manual override
- Entries that duplicate existing ones for the same kid + drill
- “Add Item” attempts while offline (show guardrail instead)

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Identical Simplified/Traditional pairs disable Drill B automatically.
- Multi-reading characters require parent confirmation of the intended Zhuyin.
- Missing dictionary results prompt manual entry and are logged in `dictionary_missing`.
- Offline training attempt pauses session with themed modal until network recovers.

---

## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### Design Decision: Adopt Supabase-centric dictionary & per-drill practice state
- Frontend (React + Vite + TS) consumes Supabase RPCs for dictionary lookups and persists familiarity state in IndexedDB for responsiveness.
- Backend (Supabase Postgres) stores per `(kid, entry, drill)` counters, curated confusion maps, and missing-entry logs; RLS ties all data to the authenticated parent.
- Training mode runs full-screen (landscape-optimized) with simple "Exit Training" button to return to dashboard; parent supervision assumed (no passcode needed).

### Component Validation Requirements
- [ ] Validate Add Item inputs (Zhuyin tones, duplicate detection, drill applicability)
- [ ] Validate drill output (4 distinct options, correct answer present)
- [ ] Attach familiarity increment/decrement confidence (first vs second try)
- [ ] Provide fallbacks (manual entry, heuristic distractors, offline guard)
- [ ] Instrument logs (practice events, dictionary misses, error reporting)

### Data Flow
1. Parent adds character → frontend calls Supabase dictionary RPC → receives canonical mapping or “missing” notice → optional manual override → entry stored with `applicable_drills`.
2. Kid training fetches queue per drill ordered by familiarity/struggle state, renders options using confusion data.
3. Each attempt writes to `practice_events`, updates `practice_state` counters, recalculates familiarity in UI.
4. Dashboard aggregates familiarity (weighted sums), accuracy (correct attempts / total), belts (threshold table), known status (computed rule).

## ✅ **DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR THIS PROJECT**

### Technical Standards Reference
- Pending `docs/operational/DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md`; until then, follow this guide and root docs.

### Before Each Feature
1. Confirm requirements with user; list acceptance criteria.
2. Present 2–3 solution options (especially for new drills or data flows).
3. Ship minimal end-to-end path (dictionary lookup → drill render → familiarity update) before enhancements.
4. Test against real characters provided by the user (tones, identical Trad/Simp, multi-reading cases).

### During Development
- Validate inputs at every boundary (forms, RPC payloads).
- Treat external data as untrusted; handle missing/conflicting dictionary data gracefully.
- Surface confidence context in UI copy (e.g., when manual data is used).
- Emit actionable errors (what failed, how it impacts parent/kid experience).
- Exercise offline guard scenarios and training mode transitions.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Feature works end-to-end with production-like data
- [ ] Input validation catches malformed/duplicate entries
- [ ] Failures map to specific components with recovery paths
- [ ] Logic mirrors agreed manual workflow and dojo narrative
- [ ] User (parent) has reviewed behavior and confirmed acceptance

## 🗄️ **DICTIONARY STATUS**

### **Migration 010a (2025-11-10) - Phase 1 Complete**
**Fixed:**
- ✅ 248 characters with empty tone marks → "ˉ" (first tone)
- ✅ 22 critical multi-pronunciation characters with proper `zhuyin_variants`
- ✅ Added missing character 麼

**Deferred to Epic 8 (139 characters):**
- 📋 37 known multi-pronunciation characters (needs context research)
- 📋 102 ambiguous 2-syllable characters (needs triage)

**Coverage:**
- Total entries: 1,000 characters
- Properly structured: 862 characters (86%)
- Known correct variants: 2 characters (了, 着)
- Remaining work: Epic 8 in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` (139 chars, 20 pts, phased approach)

---

## 📝 **KEY ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS**

**These decisions shape current implementation - historical context in SESSION_LOG.md**

### Scoring & Progression
- Familiarity scoring: +1.0 first try, +0.5 second try, 0 for wrong twice
- Known status: computed dynamically per drill (not stored flag)
- Demotion rule: 2+ consecutive misses removes "known" status until 2 new successes

### Dictionary System
- Multi-pronunciation characters use `zhuyin_variants` with context words (e.g., 着/著: zháo/zhuó/zhe)
- Dictionary lookup searches both simplified AND traditional columns
- Missing entries logged to `dictionary_missing` for expansion tracking
- Reference: `docs/operational/DICTIONARY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`

### Training Mode UX
- Full-screen landscape-optimized for tablets
- Simple "Exit Training" button (no passcode - parent supervision assumed)
- Offline detection: dual check (navigator.onLine + Supabase test query)
- Training pauses automatically when offline with dojo-themed modal

### Data Architecture
- Per-drill practice state: `(kid_id, entry_id, drill)` with separate counters
- Dictionary: public read-only reference data
- User data: protected by RLS tied to `auth.uid()`
- Practice events: immutable append-only log for analytics

### UI/UX Patterns
- Zhuyin displayed horizontally (ㄓㄠˊ) matching Taiwan textbook format
- 300ms debounced dictionary lookup for responsiveness
- Drill selection modal before training (proficiency-based recommendations)
- Sticky action bar for primary functions (Add Item, Launch Training)

### Dictionary Demo Interface
- **Lookup button:** User-facing feature - check if character exists before adding to Entry Catalog
- **Batch Test button:** Removed from UI (Session 8, Nov 10 2025) - was developer-only testing tool with no user value
- **Rationale:** Batch Test confused users ("What does this do? Why these 10 characters?")
- **Developer access:** Still available via browser console: `dictionaryClient.batchLookup(['太', '阳', ...])`

**For detailed historical context and session-by-session discoveries, see:** `SESSION_LOG.md`

## 🧭 **DEVELOPMENT GUIDANCE**

### Project-Specific Context
- Training emulates dojo discipline: accuracy over speed, belts as motivation.
- Parent console must remain calm, informative, bilingual-friendly; kid mode emphasizes large touch interaction and Sensei feedback.
- Dictionary-backed auto-fill is core to reducing parent friction; manual entry must feel guided.

### Validation Requirements
- [ ] Graceful handling of incomplete dictionary data (manual override + logging)
- [ ] Confidence indicators when manual data is used
- [ ] Clear attribution when drills fail (dictionary missing vs. Supabase error)
- [ ] End-to-end flows verified with real character samples from the family’s curriculum
- [ ] Success tracked against weekly familiarity gains and belt milestones

### Collaborative Checkpoints
- Before major changes: “Does this align with your family’s study routine?”
- After implementation: “Try this with today’s characters—does it match expectations?”
- When issues arise: “Should we adjust the approach or add safeguards?”
- Before scaling features: “Are we ready to expand dictionary coverage or introduce new drills?”

## 🔧 **CLAUDE.MD MAINTENANCE**
1. Update current priority and requirement log entries each session.
2. Record major decisions here; use `SESSION_LOG.md` for detailed narratives.
3. When file grows long, archive older context into `SESSION_LOG.md` to keep this guide concise.
4. Keep requirements, constraints, and checkpoints current so future sessions ramp quickly.
