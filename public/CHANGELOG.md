## March 2, 2026 - Session 30

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Drill C Now Catches ALL Ambiguous Word Pairs
- **Comprehensive vocabulary coverage**: Drill C now uses the full Taiwan Ministry of Education dictionary (~87,000 word pairs) to detect ambiguous matches
  - Before: Only checked against word pairs your child was practicing (~600 pairs), so real words like 風光, 聲色, 氣色 could still cause unfair "wrong" answers
  - After: Every known 2-character Traditional Chinese word is checked — no more hidden ambiguity
- **Smarter filtering**: Only flags ambiguity for words your child would actually recognize (both characters must be in their learned set)
- **Practice content stays kid-friendly**: Only curated word pairs (~500) appear in practice — the full dictionary is used only for detecting conflicts behind the scenes

---

## February 22, 2026 - Session 29

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Drills No Longer Exit Accidentally on Mobile
- **Fixed random exits**: Drills A and B would sometimes exit unexpectedly on iPhones and iPads when Aiden's finger swiped near the left edge of the screen
  - This triggered Safari's built-in "go back" gesture, which navigated away from training mode
  - Training mode now blocks accidental back-swipes — the only way to exit is by tapping the Exit button
- **No more pull-to-refresh**: Swiping down during practice no longer reloads the page
- **Faster taps**: Removed the tiny delay iOS adds to detect double-taps, so answer buttons respond instantly

---

## February 15, 2026 - Session 28

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Drill C Word Pairs Now Correctly Filter by Pronunciation
- **Fixed pronunciation filtering**: Multi-pronunciation characters (like 的, 有, 傳) now properly show only word pairs that match the chosen pronunciation
  - Example: If you saved 的 with the "de" reading, 的確 (which uses the "dí" reading) no longer appears in Drill C
- **Fixed data pipeline**: 13 characters with missing word-pair data have been restored from the dictionary
- **Preserved Drill C access**: 49 single-pronunciation characters that were at risk of disappearing from Drill C have been protected

---

## January 19, 2026 - Session 27

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Drill C No More Unfair Matches
- **Fixed ambiguous word pairs**: In Word Match (Drill C), it was possible for a character to validly match multiple options in the same round
  - Example: If both 太陽 (sun) and 太長 (too long) were in the same round, tapping 太 then 長 would be marked wrong even though it's a real word!
  - Now each character can only match exactly one option per round - no more unfair "wrong" answers
- **Cleaner rounds**: Both left and right columns are now guaranteed to have unique characters

---

## January 18, 2026 - Session 26

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Training and Drill C Restored
- **Fixed critical bug**: Training modal was showing "No items available" even when you had characters to practice
  - This was caused by a database error introduced in yesterday's update
  - All three drills (A, B, and C) are now working again
- **Drill C back on dashboard**: Word Match is now visible again in the Drill Proficiency Overview

### 🐛 Bug Fix: Word Pairs Now Appear for Multi-Pronunciation Characters
- **Fixed missing word pairs**: Word pairs like 到處, 因為, 什麼, 怎麼 were not appearing in Drill C for characters with locked pronunciations
  - This was caused by a data mismatch: some saved pronunciation data used simplified Chinese (处, 为, 么) while word pairs use traditional (處, 為, 麼)
  - All 12 affected words have been converted to traditional Chinese
- **Characters fixed**: 處, 著, 為, 什, 麼, 並 now correctly show their word pairs in Drill C

---

## January 17, 2026 - Session 25

### 🎮 Improvement: Easier Word Match for Young Learners
- **Starting characters are now familiar**: Word Match (Drill C) now only shows word pairs where the first character (left column) is one you've already learned
  - Previously, word pairs could appear if you knew either character, which meant seeing unfamiliar characters on the left
  - Now you'll always recognize the starting character, making it easier to figure out the word
- **Less frustration**: Young learners can focus on learning the second character in context, rather than being confused by unknown starting characters

---

## January 12, 2026 - Session 24

### ✨ Enhancement: Smarter Word Pairs for Multi-Pronunciation Characters
- **Pronunciation-aware filtering**: Drill C now only shows word pairs that match the pronunciation you selected when adding a character
  - Example: If you saved 著 with the "zhe" pronunciation (as in 看著 "looking at"), you'll only see word pairs using that pronunciation
  - Previously, you might see 著名 (famous, uses "zhù") even though you're learning the particle form
- **Better learning experience**: Children won't be confused by words using pronunciations they haven't learned yet

### 🔧 Technical
- Added authorization check to word pairs API for improved security
- Fixed duplicate word pairs issue in database

---

## January 12, 2026 - Session 23

### ✨ New Feature: Drill C (Word Match)
- **New Practice Drill!** Match character pairs to form 2-character Chinese words
  - Left column shows first characters, right column shows second characters
  - Tap one character, then tap its pair to form a word (e.g., 太 + 陽 = 太陽)
  - Same scoring as other drills: +1.0 first try, +0.5 second try, 0 for two wrong guesses
  - Zhuyin (pronunciation) shown under each character to help sound out unfamiliar ones
- **Available when ready**: Drill C appears in selection modal when you have at least 5 eligible word pairs
- **Visual feedback**: Matched pairs turn green with connecting lines (on tablet/desktop)

### 🎨 Improvements
- **Drill Proficiency for Drill C**: Dashboard widget now shows accuracy stats for all three drills
- **Drill Selection Modal**: Drill C now displays accuracy percentage and item count (matching Drills A & B)
- **Consistent Design**: Drill C uses the same Ninjago design system as other drills (white cards, green energy theme, badge indicator)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Mobile Display**: Fixed connecting lines that were rendering incorrectly on phones (hidden on mobile, visible on tablets)
- **Drill Switching**: Fixed brief "No practice items" flash when switching between drills mid-session
- **Card Colors**: Fixed cards to show white/gray by default, green only after successful match

### 📚 Documentation
- Added comprehensive QA checklist for drill features based on session learnings
- Added Chinese language feature requirements checklist to catch multi-pronunciation and matching logic issues earlier

---

## January 7, 2026 - Session 22

### ✨ New Features
- **Drill Proficiency Widget**: New dashboard section showing accuracy and struggling characters per drill
  - Toggle between "Last Week" and "Last 60 Days" to see recent vs. long-term accuracy trends
  - Click on struggling count to see which specific characters need more practice
  - Drill-specific layouts: Drill A shows Zhuyin prominently, Drill B shows Traditional prominently

### 🎨 Improvements
- **Faster Widget Loading**: Drill proficiency data loads 3x faster with parallel database queries
- **Smarter Dictionary Lookups**: Batch lookups now use a single request instead of 50 separate calls
- **Clearer Labels**: "Currently struggling" text clarifies that struggling count reflects present state (not filtered by timeframe)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Timezone Consistency**: Accuracy calculations now use UTC consistently, fixing off-by-one day errors for users in different timezones
- **Error Handling**: Widget and modal now display helpful error messages instead of showing stale data when API calls fail

---

## January 6, 2026 - Session 21

### 🐛 Bug Fix
- **Drill A Mobile Layout**: Fixed accidental page refresh on iPhone when practicing. Previously, the 4 Zhuyin options were stacked vertically on mobile, requiring scrolling that triggered iOS Safari's pull-to-refresh gesture. Now options display in a 2×2 grid (matching Drill B), so everything fits on screen without scrolling.

---

## December 12, 2025 - Session 20

### 🎨 Design System Unification
- **Consistent Typography**: All section headers now use the Bungee font (Ninjago theme) across the entire app. Dashboard metrics, Practice Demo, My Characters, Dictionary, and Missing tabs all share the same visual style
- **Fire Theme Login**: Sign-in screen now matches the app's fire gradient theme with improved focus states (blue highlight on form inputs)
- **Button Consistency**: Standardized button styles throughout:
  - Fire buttons (red) for primary actions like Delete, End Training, Exit
  - Lightning buttons (blue) for secondary actions like Dictionary Lookup
  - Gray utility buttons for Reset and Toggle controls
- **Unified Backgrounds**: Training mode and auth screens use the same dynamic fire gradient
- **Design System Documentation**: Created internal style guide for maintaining visual consistency in future updates

---

## December 9, 2025 - Session 19

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Correct Meanings for Multi-Pronunciation Characters**: Fixed 160 characters where all pronunciations incorrectly showed the same meaning. Now each pronunciation displays its distinct definition:
  - 长 cháng: "long, length" vs zhǎng: "to grow, chief"
  - 好 hǎo: "good, well" vs hào: "to like, be fond of"
  - 少 shǎo: "few, little" vs shào: "young"
  - And 157 more characters with correct pronunciation-specific meanings!
- **Grammatical Particles**: Added meanings for 着 (zhe/zhuó/zháo/zhāo) and 了 (le/liǎo) which were previously blank
- **Consistent Traditional Context Words**: Unified all 73 characters with mixed simplified/traditional example words to use Traditional Chinese consistently (為了, 沒有, 還是, etc.)

---

## December 8, 2025 - Session 18

### ✨ Comprehensive Multi-Pronunciation Coverage
- **162 Characters Enhanced**: Added context words and alternate pronunciations for characters that were missing them

- **68 Context Word Updates**: Filled in example words for characters already marked as multi-pronunciation but missing context, like 禁 (jìn "forbid" / jīn "to restrain oneself"), 散 (sàn "to scatter" / sǎn "loose"), and 咖 (kā "coffee" / gā "curry")
- **Taiwan MOE Cross-Reference**: Used official Taiwan Ministry of Education polyphone list to ensure comprehensive coverage

### 🎨 Improvements
- **Better Drill A Options**: With complete pronunciation data, Drill A now correctly excludes valid alternate readings from wrong answer choices across all 162 characters

---

## December 6, 2025 - Session 17

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Character 处 (chǔ/chù)**: Fixed Drill A incorrectly marking the 4th tone as wrong. Both pronunciations now accepted:
  - chǔ (3rd tone): "to deal with, get along" as in 相处, 处理
  - chù (4th tone): "place, location" as in 办事处, 好处, 到处

---
